Overview: 
This project was designed to show case information, pictures and enable a way to contact me. The website's home page includes a selfie portrait of me and a short summary containing some general information about where I am from, my hobbies and my puppy. As the user makes their way throught the links provided on the nav bar they are able to access my portfolio, contact informaiton and links to my LinkedIn and GitHub accounts. 

Motivation: 
My motivation behind the construction of this website was to use it as a tool availble to viewers to 'get to know me' in a matter of minutes or even seconds. The about me home page is short and sweet where they can quickly see my name and evaluate my interests. The portfolio contains pictures of me and other people who are important to me. Finally, the contact page is gives the user the option to enter their information and a brief message. 

Code Style: 
For this project I used semantic HTML in order to clearly separate the elements throughout my webpage. Semantic HTML helps create interfaces that work for everyone. This is important so that my website is accessbile across multiple browsers and viewports. It also allows anyone who needs to view my code the ability to follow it easier; this is necessary for grading and collaboration with other coders. 

Bootstrap was also a huge component in building my web page. To begin with bootstrap I copy and pasted the relative link and just starting plugging and chugging to make my website resemble the website criteria. One tip I found helpful was using the 4.5 version of bootstrap... it actually was a better for for this applicaiton and led me to a quicker solution. Bootstrap is a great tool when constructing a website because it already has a pre-structured CSS layout and saves a ton of time.

How to use:
My Custom Portfolio website was built so the user was able to navigate through it with ease. When the user first visits the page they are already in the main section. The nav bar located at the top of the page allows them to access other links: portfolio, contact and social media. All of those links are self explainatory and take the user to a clear cut outline of what to expect when they intially click on the link.
